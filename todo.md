Todo:
- General:
    - Rendering on big screens/small screens. (Mediaqueries)
    - Add more distinguished separation between sections. Projects, Experience, etc.
- Navbar:
    - Make buttons "RenderButton" instead or style
    - Line for start of socials area
    - Make it almost like a new page, to cover everything. Menu looks weird when you dont click it at the top of the page.
- Experience:
    - ~~Font size relative to screen size. Currently a little big~~ Adjust font size
    - For smaller sizes, make them stack on eachother. Bigger, make them more spacious
- Projects:
    - Made cards. Eventually make them flow smoother 
    - Mediaqueries text/stacking
- Skills:
    - Make skills section more throughout. As in, maybe add the cards elsewhere or show the technologies uses more creatively throughout projects. Brainstorm
