            Hi there and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Kevin, an aspiring software engineer from the New York area. 
            I'm a computer science student studying at the College of Staten Island. 
            I've always been fascinated by computers and coding, but especially learning. 
            I love to be challenged and to problem solve. 
            Working alongside others encourages me to further challenge myself, and opens up many doors to learn even more from! 
            This portfolio certainly will showcase my problem-solving and development skills.
            </p>
